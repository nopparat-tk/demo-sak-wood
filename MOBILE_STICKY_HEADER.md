# Mobile Sticky Header Implementation

## Overview
The mobile menu (`MobileMenu.jsx`) has been enhanced with sticky header functionality that provides improved visual feedback and enhanced styling when the user scrolls.

## Features Added

### 1. Scroll Detection
- Added `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to detect scroll position
- Triggers sticky mode when user scrolls more than 100px from the top
- Automatically removes sticky styling when scrolled back to top

### 2. Enhanced Styling
- **Backdrop Blur**: Added blur effects for modern glass-morphism appearance
- **Enhanced Transparency**: Semi-transparent background with better contrast
- **Improved Shadows**: Added subtle shadows for depth
- **Hover Effects**: Enhanced interactive elements with smooth transitions
- **Better Scrollbar**: Custom styled scrollbar for the menu content

### 3. Responsive Design
- Maintains mobile-first approach
- Automatically hides on desktop (1200px+)
- Optimized for smaller screens (480px and below)

## Files Modified

### 1. `components/layout/MobileMenu.jsx`
- Added scroll state management
- Added scroll event listener with cleanup
- Applied conditional CSS class based on scroll state

### 2. `app/[locale]/layout.jsx`
- Added import for the new mobile sticky CSS file

### 3. `public/assets/css/mobile-sticky.css` (New File)
- Complete styling for sticky mobile menu
- Enhanced visual effects and animations
- Responsive breakpoints
- Custom scrollbar styling

## How It Works

1. **Scroll Detection**: The component listens for scroll events and tracks when the user scrolls past 100px
2. **Class Application**: When scrolled, the `mobile-nav__wrapper--sticky` class is applied
3. **Enhanced Styling**: The CSS provides enhanced visual effects including:
   - Backdrop blur effects
   - Semi-transparent backgrounds
   - Improved shadows and borders
   - Smooth hover animations
   - Enhanced close button styling

## Usage

The sticky header functionality is automatically active. When users:
- Scroll down more than 100px: Sticky styling is applied
- Scroll back to top: Normal styling is restored
- Open mobile menu while scrolled: Enhanced sticky appearance is shown

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with backdrop-filter support
- Graceful fallback for older browsers (without blur effects)
- Webkit prefixes included for Safari compatibility

## Customization

To modify the scroll threshold, edit the value in `MobileMenu.jsx`:
```javascript
const scrollCheck = window.scrollY > 100; // Change 100 to desired value
```

To customize styling, edit `public/assets/css/mobile-sticky.css` and modify the `.mobile-nav__wrapper--sticky` class and its children.
